**System requirements:** Android 7.0 (SDK 24) and higher

**Compiled for:** Android 11.0 (SDK 30)

Currently, the app only consists of a recruitment calculator.

The interface is pretty simple:

You just select the tags you got from the game, scroll down below, and the app will show you all possible combinations with selected tags. You can only select a maximum of 5 tags, since we can only select 5 of them in the game.

You can reset all of the selected buttons and clear the results using the "Reset selection" button.

# Short-term TO-DO:
- Sort output by rarity
- Exclude 6-star operators from results if "Top Operator" tag was not selected
- Proper results designing
