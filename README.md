Currently, the app only consists of a recruitment calculator.

The interface is pretty simple:

You just select the tags you got from the game, scroll down below, and the app will show you all possible combinations with selected tags. You can only select a maximum of 5 tags, since we can only select 5 of them in the game. You won't be able to select other tags until you uncheck some of the already selected ones or press reset tags.

You can tap on each operator name to view his details:

Groups with multiple tags selected (like "AoE, Guard" group on screenshot below, or "Slow, Melee, Guard" above) are brought higher than groups with less tags, and each group is sorted by operator rarity in a descending order:
