**System requirements:** Android 7.0 (SDK 24) and higher

Currently, the app only consists of a recruitment calculator.

The interface is pretty simple:

You just select the tags you got from the game, scroll down below, and the app will show you all possible combinations with selected tags. You can only select a maximum of 5 tags, since we can only select 5 of them in the game. You won't be able to select other tags until you uncheck some of the already selected ones.

You can reset all of the selected buttons and clear the results using the "Reset tags" button.

You can tap on each operator name to view his details

# Short-term TO-DO:
- Group similar tags together and sort those groups by rarity
