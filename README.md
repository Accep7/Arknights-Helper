# Arknights Helper
**System requirements:** Android 7.0 (SDK 24) and higher

**Compiled for:** Android 11.0 (SDK 30)

Currently, the app only consists of a recruitment calculator.

The interface is pretty simple:

You just select the tags you got from the game, scroll down below, and the app will show you all possible combinations with selected tags. You can only select a maximum of 5 tags, since we can only select 5 of them in the game. You won't be able to select other tags until you uncheck some of the already selected ones.

You can reset all of the selected buttons and clear the results using the "Reset selection" button.

# Short-term TO-DO:
- Sort output by rarity
- Exclude 6-star operators from results if "Top Operator" tag was not selected
- Proper results designing
